### Installation
Perform the following steps for a minimal installation. For actual applications, simply install pyMMAX2 and its required dependencies (if not installed already) into your working environment.

```
$ conda create --name pymmax2 python=3.6 colorama beautifulsoup4 regex jpype1
$ source activate pymmax2
$ pip install lxml
$ git clone https://github.com/nlpAThits/pyMMAX2.git
$ cd pyMMAX2
$ pip install .
```

If you want to use the JPype-based integration of the MMAX2 annotation scheme business logic, e.g. for purposes of validation, you need a current MMAX2 version. This can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/nlpAThits/MMAX2">here</a>.
